# Object-Detection-And-Dimension-Assessment
The main idea behind using the concept is to identify, detect and measure the objects using Python Language. Objectives of the project are:
1.) To develop a system, capable of effectively identifying objects within images or frames.
2.) To implement a robust mechanism for accurately measuring the dimensions of detected objects.
3.) To improve the overall accuracy of object detection and dimension measurement processes.
Our project lies in the category of-
• Machine Learning
• Artificial Intelligence
• Natural Language Processing
• Image Processing
